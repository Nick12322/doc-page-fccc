            <p>Javascript is a language used all across the web in order to script websites. A lot of features you use everyday on a website wouldn't work without javscript</p>
            <p>For example, it would be nearly impossible to create an account and sign into it on a website such as facebook, without javascript.</p>

            <p>This guide / documentation assumes you have some working knowledge of web design basics through html and css</p>
            <p>The javascript fundamentals however are going to be made as simply to understand as possible, for users of all levels.</p>

            <p>Javascript and Java are both programming languages, but that's about where the similarities end.</p>
            <p>Javascript code is NOT Java code, and the two are NOT interchangable.</p>

        <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Here, we are going to write out first "Hello World" using javascript.</p>
            <code id="helloworldcode" class="code">function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName);
              }
              greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Copy and paste that code into your scratchpad and watch your first javascript program work!</p>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are used to store values. You can use any letter, symbol, or number as a variable, to store any information. For example:</p>
            <code id="Variable_Code" class="code"> var x = "y"</code>
            <p>If you were to plug into your scratchpad now <code id="alertx_Code" class="code">alert(x)</code> you should get an alert displaying the letter y</p>

        <section id="Declaring_Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>There are three ways to declare a variable in javascript. First, the var method:</p>
                <code id="VarCode" class="code"> var x = 42</code>
            <p>This can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>Second is the let method:</p>
                <code id="LetCode" class="code">let x = 42</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.</p>
            <p>Finally, a variable can be simply assigned a value, like so</p>
                <code id="assignCode" class="code"> x = 42</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
